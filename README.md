Astro is an engine made following a series on YouTube by thecherno at [thecherno.com/engine](https://thecherno.com/engine).

## Getting Started

Developed currently only in Visual Studio 2022, only Windows is supported at the moment.

Clone the repository using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/tannerhbrewer/Astro`

## Future Plans

Along with continuing to follow the series, I plan to make this more customized to me as time goes on
and learn about rendering and modern C++ applications.
